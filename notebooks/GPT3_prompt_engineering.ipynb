      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological functions. Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO(2) in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for 1 h with 10 µL L(-1) NO(2.) Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen resistance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease resistance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO(2)-induced resistance against B. cinerea An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO(2) exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO(2)-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO(2)-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO(2)-triggered B. cinerea resistance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and CYTOCHROME P450 79B2 (CYP79B2), CYP79B3, and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 gene functions but independent of camalexin, CYP81F2, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO(2) triggers basal pathogen resistance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO(2) in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.\n"

These phytochrome-mediated responses include hyponasty (i.e. a more vertical orientation of leaves) and enhanced stem and petiole elongation. We showed recently that ethylene-insensitive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants (Tetr) have reduced responses to neighbors, showing an important role for this gaseous plant hormone in shade avoidance. Here, we investigate interactions between phytochrome signaling and ethylene action in shade avoidance responses. Furthermore, we investigate if ethylene acts in these responses through an interaction with the GA class of hormones. Low red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) enhanced ethylene production in wild-type tobacco, resulting in shade avoidance responses, whereas ethylene-insensitive plants showed reduced shade avoidance responses. Plants with inhibited GA production showed hardly any shade avoidance responses at all to either a low R:FR or increased ethylene concentrations. Furthermore, low R:FR enhanced the responsiveness of hyponasty and stem elongation in both wild-type and Tetr plants to applied GA(3), with the stem elongation process being more responsive to GA(3) in the wild type than in Tetr. We conclude that phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses involve ethylene action, at least partly by modulating GA action.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) encodes a soluble gibberellin (GA) receptor that shares sequence similarity with a hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Previously, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed that the GID1-GA complex directly interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor protein in GA signaling. Here, we demonstrated, by pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, that the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction also occurs in planta. GA(4) was found to have the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta. Domain analyses of SLR1 using Y2H, gel filtration, and BiFC methods revealed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1-SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1, such as the spontaneous mutant GID1s, N- and C-terminal truncated GID1s, and mutagenized GID1 proteins with conserved amino acids replaced with Ala. The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding that were scattered throughout the GID1 molecule. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure predicted by analogy with HSL tertiary structure, many residues were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Furthermore, the GA-GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. Based on these observations, we proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: BACKGROUND: Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium species like F. graminearum is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality. Resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, but the molecular events leading to FHB resistance are still poorly understood. Transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars Dream (moderately resistant) and Lynx (susceptible). The gene expressions at 32 and 72 h after inoculation with Fusarium were used to trace possible defence mechanisms and associated genes. A comparative qPCR was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3 (Chinese spring wheat). RESULTS: Among 2,169 differentially expressed genes, two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the FHB-resistant Dream cultivar. Both are defined base on their specific mode of resistance. A non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling, including lipid-transfer protein, thionin, defensin and GDSL-like lipase genes. Additionally, defence-related genes encoding jasmonate-regulated proteins were up-regulated in response to FHB. Another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential Fusarium virulence factors comprising proteases and mycotoxins was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat. Moreover, similar inductions upon fungal infection were frequently observed among FHB-responsive genes of both mechanisms in the cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. CONCLUSIONS: Especially ABC transporter, UDP-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors are apparently active in different resistant genetic backgrounds, according to reports on other wheat cultivars and barley. This was further supported in our qPCR experiments on seven genes originating from this mechanism which revealed similar activities in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. Finally, the combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars. The respective mechanisms are attractive for advanced studies aiming at new resistance and toxin management strategies.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are small, basic cystein-rich proteins believed to be involved in plant defense mechanisms. Three cDNAs coding nsLTPs from grape (Vitis vinifera sp.) were cloned by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR. The expression of nsLTP genes was investigated in 41B-rootstock grape cell suspension, in response to various defense-related signal molecules. Ergosterol (a fungi-specific sterol) and a proteinaceous elicitor purified from Botrytis cinerea strongly and rapidly induced the accumulation of nsLTP mRNAs. Jasmonic acid, cholesterol, and sitosterol also promoted nsLTPs mRNA accumulation, although to a lesser extent, whereas salicylic acid had no effect. High performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the amounts of three LTP isoforms (previously named P1, P2, and P4) were increased by ergosterol. None of the four isoforms displayed any significant antifungal properties, with the exception of the P4 isoform, which reduced Botrytis mycelium growth in vitro, but only in calcium-free medium. The results are discussed in the context of plant-pathogen interactions.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: In plants, ethylene and jasmonate control the defense responses to multiple stressors, including insect predation. Among the defense proteins known to be regulated by ethylene is maize insect resistance 1-cysteine protease (Mir1-CP). This protein is constitutively expressed in the insect-resistant maize (Zea mays) genotype Mp708; however, its abundance significantly increases during fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory. Within 1 h of herbivory by fall armyworm, Mir1-CP accumulates at the feeding site and continues to increase in abundance until 24 h without any increase in its transcript (mir1) levels. To resolve this discrepancy and elucidate the role of ethylene and jasmonate in the signaling of Mir1-CP expression, the effects of phytohormone biosynthesis and perception inhibitors on Mir1-CP expression were tested. Immunoblot analysis of Mir1-CP accumulation and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction examination of mir1 levels in these treated plants demonstrate that Mir1-CP accumulation is regulated by both transcript abundance and protein expression levels. The results also suggest that jasmonate functions upstream of ethylene in the Mir1-CP expression pathway, allowing for both low-level constitutive expression and a two-stage defensive response, an immediate response involving Mir1-CP accumulation and a delayed response inducing mir1 transcript expression.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: In plants, 14-3-3 proteins are important modulators of protein-protein interactions in response to environmental stresses. The aim of the present work was to characterize one Opuntia ficus-indica 14-3-3 and get information about its client proteins. To achieve this goal, O. ficus-indica 14-3-3 cDNA, named as Op14-3-3 μ, was amplified by 3'-RACE methodology. Op14-3-3 μ contains an Open Reading Frame of 786 bp encoding a 261 amino acids protein. Op14-3-3 μ cDNA was cloned into a bacterial expression system and recombinant protein was purified. Differential Scanning Fluorimetry, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry were used for Op14-3-3 μ protein characterization, and Affinity-Purification-Mass Spectrometry analysis approach was used to obtain information about their potential client proteins. Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit, and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase were identified. Interestingly chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase was also identified. Op14-3-3 μ down-regulation was observed in Opuntia calluses when they were induced with Jasmonic Acid, while increased accumulation of Op14-3-3 μ protein was observed. The putative interaction of 14-3-3 μ with chorismate mutase, which have not been reported before, suggest that Op14-3-3 μ could be an important regulator of metabolites biosynthesis and responses to stress in Opuntia spp. SIGNIFICANCE: Opuntia species are important crops in arid and semiarid areas worldwide, but despite its relevance, little information about their tolerance mechanism to cope with harsh environmental conditions is reported. 14-3-3 proteins have gained attention due to its participation as protein-protein regulators and have been linked with primary metabolism and hormones responses. Here we present the characterization of the first Opuntia ficus-indica 14-3-3 (Op14-3-3) protein using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy. Op14-3-3 has high homology with other 14-3-3 from Caryophyllales. A novel Op14-3-3 client protein has been identified; the chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase, key enzyme that links the primary with secondary metabolism. The present results open new questions about the Opuntia spp. pathways mechanisms in response to environmental stress and the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in betalains biosynthesis.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: Plants under stress from both biotic and abiotic sources produce increased levels of ethylene, which is perceived by ethylene receptors and triggers cellular responses further downstream. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were implicated in the regulation of ethylene induction by stresses based on studies using protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. However, the kinase(s) involved remains to be determined. Using a conditional gain-of-function transgenic system, we demonstrate that the activation of SIPK, a tobacco mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), by NtMEK2DD, an active mutant of the upstream kinase of SIPK, resulted in a dramatic increase in ethylene production. The increase in ethylene after the activation of SIPK coincided with a dramatic increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) activity, which was followed by the activation of a subgroup of ACS and ACC oxidase (ACO) genes, suggesting that either the activation of unidentified ACS(s) or post-transcriptional regulation is involved. Infection with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which is known to activate the SIPK cascade and induce ethylene biosynthesis, also induced the same ACSs and ACOs. After ethylene production in NtMEK2DD plants, strong activation of ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) genes was observed, similar to the effect in NN tobacco plants infected with TMV. In contrast to previous reports, no major increase in jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MJ) was detected after the activation of SIPK/WIPK in NtMEK2DD transgenic plants. These results suggest that the induction of ethylene but not JA/MJ is involved in plant defense responses mediated by the NtMEK2-SIPK/WIPK pathway.\n"

H(2)S is produced in plants via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways in different subcellular compartments. Exogenous application of H(2)S facilitates versatile metabolic processes and antioxidant machinery in plants under normal and environmental stresses. This compound interacts with phytohormones like auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. Furthermore, H(2)S participates in signal transductions of other signaling molecules like nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, calcium, methylglyoxal, and hydrogen peroxide. It also mediates post-translational modification, which is a protective mechanism against oxidative damage of proteins. This review summarizes the roles of H(2)S as intriguing molecule in plants.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples: Studies of the singlet oxygen ((1)O2)-overproducing flu and chlorina1 (ch1) mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have shown that (1)O2-induced changes in gene expression can lead to either programmed cell death (PCD) or acclimation. A transcriptomic analysis of the ch1 mutant has allowed the identification of genes whose expression is specifically affected by each phenomenon. One such gene is OXIDATIVE SIGNAL INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) encoding an AGC kinase that was noticeably induced by excess light energy and (1)O2 stress conditions leading to cell death. Photo-induced oxidative damage and cell death were drastically reduced in the OXI1 null mutant (oxi1) and in the double mutant ch1*oxi1 compared with the wild type and the ch1 single mutant, respectively. This occurred without any changes in the production rate of (1)O2 but was cancelled by exogenous applications of the phytohormone jasmonate. OXI1-mediated (1)O2 signaling appeared to operate through a different pathway from the previously characterized OXI1-dependent response to pathogens and H2O2 and was found to be independent of the EXECUTER proteins. In high-light-stressed plants, the oxi1 mutation was associated with reduced jasmonate levels and with the up-regulation of genes encoding negative regulators of jasmonate signaling and PCD. Our results show that OXI1 is a new regulator of (1)O2-induced PCD, likely acting upstream of jasmonate.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples in the format (\"Subject\", \"predicate\", \"Object\"): Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological functions. Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO(2) in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for 1 h with 10 µL L(-1) NO(2.) Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen resistance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease resistance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO(2)-induced resistance against B. cinerea An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO(2) exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO(2)-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO(2)-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO(2)-triggered B. cinerea resistance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and CYTOCHROME P450 79B2 (CYP79B2), CYP79B3, and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 gene functions but independent of camalexin, CYP81F2, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO(2) triggers basal pathogen resistance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO(2) in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.\n"

These phytochrome-mediated responses include hyponasty (i.e. a more vertical orientation of leaves) and enhanced stem and petiole elongation. We showed recently that ethylene-insensitive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants (Tetr) have reduced responses to neighbors, showing an important role for this gaseous plant hormone in shade avoidance. Here, we investigate interactions between phytochrome signaling and ethylene action in shade avoidance responses. Furthermore, we investigate if ethylene acts in these responses through an interaction with the GA class of hormones. Low red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) enhanced ethylene production in wild-type tobacco, resulting in shade avoidance responses, whereas ethylene-insensitive plants showed reduced shade avoidance responses. Plants with inhibited GA production showed hardly any shade avoidance responses at all to either a low R:FR or increased ethylene concentrations. Furthermore, low R:FR enhanced the responsiveness of hyponasty and stem elongation in both wild-type and Tetr plants to applied GA(3), with the stem elongation process being more responsive to GA(3) in the wild type than in Tetr. We conclude that phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses involve ethylene action, at least partly by modulating GA action.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples in the format (\"Subject\", \"predicate\", \"Object\"): GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) encodes a soluble gibberellin (GA) receptor that shares sequence similarity with a hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Previously, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed that the GID1-GA complex directly interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor protein in GA signaling. Here, we demonstrated, by pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, that the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction also occurs in planta. GA(4) was found to have the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta. Domain analyses of SLR1 using Y2H, gel filtration, and BiFC methods revealed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1-SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1, such as the spontaneous mutant GID1s, N- and C-terminal truncated GID1s, and mutagenized GID1 proteins with conserved amino acids replaced with Ala. The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding that were scattered throughout the GID1 molecule. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure predicted by analogy with HSL tertiary structure, many residues were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Furthermore, the GA-GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. Based on these observations, we proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples in the format (\"Subject\", \"predicate\", \"Object\"): BACKGROUND: Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium species like F. graminearum is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality. Resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, but the molecular events leading to FHB resistance are still poorly understood. Transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars Dream (moderately resistant) and Lynx (susceptible). The gene expressions at 32 and 72 h after inoculation with Fusarium were used to trace possible defence mechanisms and associated genes. A comparative qPCR was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3 (Chinese spring wheat). RESULTS: Among 2,169 differentially expressed genes, two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the FHB-resistant Dream cultivar. Both are defined base on their specific mode of resistance. A non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling, including lipid-transfer protein, thionin, defensin and GDSL-like lipase genes. Additionally, defence-related genes encoding jasmonate-regulated proteins were up-regulated in response to FHB. Another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential Fusarium virulence factors comprising proteases and mycotoxins was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat. Moreover, similar inductions upon fungal infection were frequently observed among FHB-responsive genes of both mechanisms in the cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. CONCLUSIONS: Especially ABC transporter, UDP-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors are apparently active in different resistant genetic backgrounds, according to reports on other wheat cultivars and barley. This was further supported in our qPCR experiments on seven genes originating from this mechanism which revealed similar activities in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. Finally, the combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars. The respective mechanisms are attractive for advanced studies aiming at new resistance and toxin management strategies.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples in the format (\"Subject\", \"predicate\", \"Object\"): In plants, ethylene and jasmonate control the defense responses to multiple stressors, including insect predation. Among the defense proteins known to be regulated by ethylene is maize insect resistance 1-cysteine protease (Mir1-CP). This protein is constitutively expressed in the insect-resistant maize (Zea mays) genotype Mp708; however, its abundance significantly increases during fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory. Within 1 h of herbivory by fall armyworm, Mir1-CP accumulates at the feeding site and continues to increase in abundance until 24 h without any increase in its transcript (mir1) levels. To resolve this discrepancy and elucidate the role of ethylene and jasmonate in the signaling of Mir1-CP expression, the effects of phytohormone biosynthesis and perception inhibitors on Mir1-CP expression were tested. Immunoblot analysis of Mir1-CP accumulation and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction examination of mir1 levels in these treated plants demonstrate that Mir1-CP accumulation is regulated by both transcript abundance and protein expression levels. The results also suggest that jasmonate functions upstream of ethylene in the Mir1-CP expression pathway, allowing for both low-level constitutive expression and a two-stage defensive response, an immediate response involving Mir1-CP accumulation and a delayed response inducing mir1 transcript expression.\n"

The aim of the present work was to characterize one Opuntia ficus-indica 14-3-3 and get information about its client proteins. To achieve this goal, O. ficus-indica 14-3-3 cDNA, named as Op14-3-3 μ, was amplified by 3'-RACE methodology. Op14-3-3 μ contains an Open Reading Frame of 786 bp encoding a 261 amino acids protein. Op14-3-3 μ cDNA was cloned into a bacterial expression system and recombinant protein was purified. Differential Scanning Fluorimetry, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry were used for Op14-3-3 μ protein characterization, and Affinity-Purification-Mass Spectrometry analysis approach was used to obtain information about their potential client proteins. Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit, and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase were identified. Interestingly chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase was also identified. Op14-3-3 μ down-regulation was observed in Opuntia calluses when they were induced with Jasmonic Acid, while increased accumulation of Op14-3-3 μ protein was observed. The putative interaction of 14-3-3 μ with chorismate mutase, which have not been reported before, suggest that Op14-3-3 μ could be an important regulator of metabolites biosynthesis and responses to stress in Opuntia spp. SIGNIFICANCE: Opuntia species are important crops in arid and semiarid areas worldwide, but despite its relevance, little information about their tolerance mechanism to cope with harsh environmental conditions is reported. 14-3-3 proteins have gained attention due to its participation as protein-protein regulators and have been linked with primary metabolism and hormones responses. Here we present the characterization of the first Opuntia ficus-indica 14-3-3 (Op14-3-3) protein using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy. Op14-3-3 has high homology with other 14-3-3 from Caryophyllales. A novel Op14-3-3 client protein has been identified; the chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase, key enzyme that links the primary with secondary metabolism. The present results open new questions about the Opuntia spp. pathways mechanisms in response to environmental stress and the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in betalains biosynthesis.\n"

      "Extract the biological relationships from the following text as (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples in the format (\"Subject\", \"predicate\", \"Object\"): Plants under stress from both biotic and abiotic sources produce increased levels of ethylene, which is perceived by ethylene receptors and triggers cellular responses further downstream. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were implicated in the regulation of ethylene induction by stresses based on studies using protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. However, the kinase(s) involved remains to be determined. Using a conditional gain-of-function transgenic system, we demonstrate that the activation of SIPK, a tobacco mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), by NtMEK2DD, an active mutant of the upstream kinase of SIPK, resulted in a dramatic increase in ethylene production. The increase in ethylene after the activation of SIPK coincided with a dramatic increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) activity, which was followed by the activation of a subgroup of ACS and ACC oxidase (ACO) genes, suggesting that either the activation of unidentified ACS(s) or post-transcriptional regulation is involved. Infection with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which is known to activate the SIPK cascade and induce ethylene biosynthesis, also induced the same ACSs and ACOs. After ethylene production in NtMEK2DD plants, strong activation of ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) genes was observed, similar to the effect in NN tobacco plants infected with TMV. In contrast to previous reports, no major increase in jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MJ) was detected after the activation of SIPK/WIPK in NtMEK2DD transgenic plants. These results suggest that the induction of ethylene but not JA/MJ is involved in plant defense responses mediated by the NtMEK2-SIPK/WIPK pathway.\n"

H(2)S is produced in plants via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways in different subcellular compartments. Exogenous application of H(2)S facilitates versatile metabolic processes and antioxidant machinery in plants under normal and environmental stresses. This compound interacts with phytohormones like auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. Furthermore, H(2)S participates in signal transductions of other signaling molecules like nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, calcium, methylglyoxal, and hydrogen peroxide. It also mediates post-translational modification, which is a protective mechanism against oxidative damage of proteins. This review summarizes the roles of H(2)S as intriguing molecule in plants.\n"

A transcriptomic analysis of the ch1 mutant has allowed the identification of genes whose expression is specifically affected by each phenomenon. One such gene is OXIDATIVE SIGNAL INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) encoding an AGC kinase that was noticeably induced by excess light energy and (1)O2 stress conditions leading to cell death. Photo-induced oxidative damage and cell death were drastically reduced in the OXI1 null mutant (oxi1) and in the double mutant ch1*oxi1 compared with the wild type and the ch1 single mutant, respectively. This occurred without any changes in the production rate of (1)O2 but was cancelled by exogenous applications of the phytohormone jasmonate. OXI1-mediated (1)O2 signaling appeared to operate through a different pathway from the previously characterized OXI1-dependent response to pathogens and H2O2 and was found to be independent of the EXECUTER proteins. In high-light-stressed plants, the oxi1 mutation was associated with reduced jasmonate levels and with the up-regulation of genes encoding negative regulators of jasmonate signaling and PCD. Our results show that OXI1 is a new regulator of (1)O2-induced PCD, likely acting upstream of jasmonate.\n"

      "Rewrite the following text to only include one subject and object per sentence: Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological functions. Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO(2) in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for 1 h with 10 µL L(-1) NO(2.) Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen resistance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease resistance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO(2)-induced resistance against B. cinerea An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO(2) exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO(2)-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO(2)-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO(2)-triggered B. cinerea resistance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and CYTOCHROME P450 79B2 (CYP79B2), CYP79B3, and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 gene functions but independent of camalexin, CYP81F2, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO(2) triggers basal pathogen resistance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO(2) in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.\n"

      "Rewrite the following text to only include one subject and object per sentence: Plants respond to proximate neighbors with a suite of responses that comprise the shade avoidance syndrome. These phytochrome-mediated responses include hyponasty (i.e. a more vertical orientation of leaves) and enhanced stem and petiole elongation. We showed recently that ethylene-insensitive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants (Tetr) have reduced responses to neighbors, showing an important role for this gaseous plant hormone in shade avoidance. Here, we investigate interactions between phytochrome signaling and ethylene action in shade avoidance responses. Furthermore, we investigate if ethylene acts in these responses through an interaction with the GA class of hormones. Low red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) enhanced ethylene production in wild-type tobacco, resulting in shade avoidance responses, whereas ethylene-insensitive plants showed reduced shade avoidance responses. Plants with inhibited GA production showed hardly any shade avoidance responses at all to either a low R:FR or increased ethylene concentrations. Furthermore, low R:FR enhanced the responsiveness of hyponasty and stem elongation in both wild-type and Tetr plants to applied GA(3), with the stem elongation process being more responsive to GA(3) in the wild type than in Tetr. We conclude that phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses involve ethylene action, at least partly by modulating GA action.\n"

Here, we demonstrated, by pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, that the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction also occurs in planta. GA(4) was found to have the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta. Domain analyses of SLR1 using Y2H, gel filtration, and BiFC methods revealed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1-SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1, such as the spontaneous mutant GID1s, N- and C-terminal truncated GID1s, and mutagenized GID1 proteins with conserved amino acids replaced with Ala. The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding that were scattered throughout the GID1 molecule. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure predicted by analogy with HSL tertiary structure, many residues were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Furthermore, the GA-GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. Based on these observations, we proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.\n"

      "Rewrite the following text to only include one subject and object per sentence: BACKGROUND: Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium species like F. graminearum is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality. Resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, but the molecular events leading to FHB resistance are still poorly understood. Transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars Dream (moderately resistant) and Lynx (susceptible). The gene expressions at 32 and 72 h after inoculation with Fusarium were used to trace possible defence mechanisms and associated genes. A comparative qPCR was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3 (Chinese spring wheat). RESULTS: Among 2,169 differentially expressed genes, two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the FHB-resistant Dream cultivar. Both are defined base on their specific mode of resistance. A non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling, including lipid-transfer protein, thionin, defensin and GDSL-like lipase genes. Additionally, defence-related genes encoding jasmonate-regulated proteins were up-regulated in response to FHB. Another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential Fusarium virulence factors comprising proteases and mycotoxins was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat. Moreover, similar inductions upon fungal infection were frequently observed among FHB-responsive genes of both mechanisms in the cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. CONCLUSIONS: Especially ABC transporter, UDP-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors are apparently active in different resistant genetic backgrounds, according to reports on other wheat cultivars and barley. This was further supported in our qPCR experiments on seven genes originating from this mechanism which revealed similar activities in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. Finally, the combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars. The respective mechanisms are attractive for advanced studies aiming at new resistance and toxin management strategies.\n"

Among the defense proteins known to be regulated by ethylene is maize insect resistance 1-cysteine protease (Mir1-CP). This protein is constitutively expressed in the insect-resistant maize (Zea mays) genotype Mp708; however, its abundance significantly increases during fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory. Within 1 h of herbivory by fall armyworm, Mir1-CP accumulates at the feeding site and continues to increase in abundance until 24 h without any increase in its transcript (mir1) levels. To resolve this discrepancy and elucidate the role of ethylene and jasmonate in the signaling of Mir1-CP expression, the effects of phytohormone biosynthesis and perception inhibitors on Mir1-CP expression were tested. Immunoblot analysis of Mir1-CP accumulation and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction examination of mir1 levels in these treated plants demonstrate that Mir1-CP accumulation is regulated by both transcript abundance and protein expression levels. The results also suggest that jasmonate functions upstream of ethylene in the Mir1-CP expression pathway, allowing for both low-level constitutive expression and a two-stage defensive response, an immediate response involving Mir1-CP accumulation and a delayed response inducing mir1 transcript expression.\n"

A transcriptomic analysis of the ch1 mutant has allowed the identification of genes whose expression is specifically affected by each phenomenon. One such gene is OXIDATIVE SIGNAL INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) encoding an AGC kinase that was noticeably induced by excess light energy and (1)O2 stress conditions leading to cell death. Photo-induced oxidative damage and cell death were drastically reduced in the OXI1 null mutant (oxi1) and in the double mutant ch1*oxi1 compared with the wild type and the ch1 single mutant, respectively. This occurred without any changes in the production rate of (1)O2 but was cancelled by exogenous applications of the phytohormone jasmonate. OXI1-mediated (1)O2 signaling appeared to operate through a different pathway from the previously characterized OXI1-dependent response to pathogens and H2O2 and was found to be independent of the EXECUTER proteins. In high-light-stressed plants, the oxi1 mutation was associated with reduced jasmonate levels and with the up-regulation of genes encoding negative regulators of jasmonate signaling and PCD. Our results show that OXI1 is a new regulator of (1)O2-induced PCD, likely acting upstream of jasmonate.\n"

      "Studies of the singlet oxygen ((1)O2)-overproducing flu and chlorina1 (ch1) mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have shown that (1)O2-induced changes in gene expression can lead to either programmed cell death (PCD) or acclimation. A transcriptomic analysis identified genes whose expression is specifically affected by each phenomenon, including OXIDATIVE SIGNAL INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) encoding an AGC kinase. OXI1 was noticeably induced by excess light energy and (1)O2 stress conditions leading to cell death. Photo-induced oxidative damage and cell death were drastically reduced in the OXI1 null mutant (oxi1) and in the double mutant ch1*oxi1 compared with the wild type and the ch1 single mutant, respectively. This occurred without any changes in the production rate of (1)O2, but was cancelled by exogenous applications of the phytohormone jasmonate. OXI1-mediated (1)O2 signaling operated through a different pathway from the previously characterized OXI1-dependent response to pathogens and H2O2 and was found to be independent of the EXECUTER proteins. In high-light-stressed plants, the oxi1 mutation was associated with reduced jasmonate levels and with the up-regulation of genes encoding negative regulators of jasmonate signaling and PCD. OXI1 was found to be a new regulator of (1)O2-induced PCD, likely acting upstream of jasmonate.\n",

We explored these functions by fumigating Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) with 10 \\u00b5L L(-1) NO(2) for 1 h. Leaf symptoms were absent, but expression of genes related to pathogen resistance was induced. This resulted in basal disease resistance against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Both salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were required for full expression of NO(2)-induced resistance against B. cinerea. An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. NO(2)-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and catabolism led to suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, accompanied by a rise in their catabolic intermediates. NO(2)-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene \\u03b1-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene). NO(2)-triggered B. cinerea resistance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and CYTOCHROME P450 79B2 (CYP79B2), CYP79B3, and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 gene functions, but independent of camalexin, CYP81F2, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. This suggests that NO(2) may play a role in defense signaling, and that jasmonate catabolism and volatiles are involved in pathogen immunity.\"\n",

These responses are mediated by phytochrome and include hyponasty and enhanced stem and petiole elongation. We recently showed that ethylene-insensitive tobacco plants (Tetr) have reduced responses to neighbors, indicating an important role for ethylene in shade avoidance. Here, we investigate interactions between phytochrome signaling and ethylene action in shade avoidance responses. We also explore if ethylene acts in these responses through an interaction with the GA class of hormones. Low red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) increased ethylene production in wild-type tobacco, resulting in shade avoidance responses. However, ethylene-insensitive plants showed reduced shade avoidance responses. Plants with inhibited GA production showed hardly any shade avoidance responses to either a low R:FR or increased ethylene concentrations. Low R:FR also enhanced the responsiveness of hyponasty and stem elongation in both wild-type and Tetr plants to applied GA(3). The stem elongation process was more responsive to GA(3) in the wild type than in Tetr. We conclude that phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses involve ethylene action, at least partly by modulating GA action.\"\n",

A Y2H assay revealed that GID1-GA directly interacts with SLR1, a DELLA repressor protein in GA signaling. We demonstrated, by pull-down and BiFC experiments, that the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction also occurs in planta. GA(4) had the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta. Domain analyses of SLR1 using Y2H, gel filtration, and BiFC methods showed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1-SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1. The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure, many were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Furthermore, the GA-GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. We proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.\"\n",

Mycotoxins produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality. Transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars Dream (moderately resistant) and Lynx (susceptible). Two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the FHB-resistant Dream cultivar. A non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling. Another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential Fusarium virulence factors was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat. Among 2,169 differentially expressed genes, ABC transporter, UDP-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors were active in different resistant genetic backgrounds. A comparative qPCR was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3 (Chinese spring wheat). The combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars. Resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, and these findings are attractive for advanced studies aiming at new resistance and toxin management strategies.\"\n",

Three cDNAs coding nsLTPs from grape (Vitis vinifera sp.) were cloned by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR. The expression of nsLTP genes was investigated in 41B-rootstock grape cell suspension, in response to various defense-related signal molecules. Ergosterol (a fungi-specific sterol) and a proteinaceous elicitor purified from Botrytis cinerea strongly and rapidly induced the accumulation of nsLTP mRNAs. Jasmonic acid, cholesterol, and sitosterol also promoted nsLTPs mRNA accumulation, although to a lesser extent, whereas salicylic acid had no effect. High performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the amounts of three LTP isoforms (previously named P1, P2, and P4) were increased by ergosterol. None of the four isoforms displayed any significant antifungal properties, with the exception of the P4 isoform, which reduced Botrytis mycelium growth in vitro, but only in calcium-free medium. The results were then discussed in the context of plant-pathogen interactions.\"\n",

Maize insect resistance 1-cysteine protease (Mir1-CP) is one of the defense proteins regulated by ethylene. It is constitutively expressed in the insect-resistant maize (Zea mays) genotype Mp708, but its abundance increases significantly during fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory. Within 1 h of herbivory, Mir1-CP accumulates at the feeding site and continues to increase in abundance until 24 h without any increase in its transcript (mir1) levels. To understand the role of ethylene and jasmonate in the signaling of Mir1-CP expression, the effects of phytohormone biosynthesis and perception inhibitors on Mir1-CP expression were tested. Immunoblot analysis and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction examination showed that Mir1-CP accumulation is regulated by both transcript abundance and protein expression levels. The results suggest that jasmonate functions upstream of ethylene in the Mir1-CP expression pathway, allowing for both low-level constitutive expression and a two-stage defensive response.\"\n",

The aim of the present work was to characterize one Opuntia ficus-indica 14-3-3 and get information about its client proteins. To achieve this goal, O. ficus-indica 14-3-3 cDNA, named as Op14-3-3\\u202f\\u03bc, was amplified by 3'-RACE methodology. It contains an Open Reading Frame of 786\\u202fbp encoding a 261 amino acids protein. Op14-3-3\\u202f\\u03bc was cloned into a bacterial expression system and recombinant protein was purified. Differential Scanning Fluorimetry, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry were used for its characterization, and Affinity-Purification-Mass Spectrometry analysis approach was used to obtain information about its potential client proteins. Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit, and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase were identified. Chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase was also identified. Op14-3-3\\u202f\\u03bc down-regulation was observed in Opuntia calluses when they were induced with Jasmonic Acid, while increased accumulation of Op14-3-3\\u202f\\u03bc protein was observed. This suggests that Op14-3-3\\u202f\\u03bc could be an important regulator of metabolites biosynthesis and responses to stress in Opuntia spp. SIGNIFICANCE: Opuntia species are important crops in arid and semiarid areas worldwide, but despite its relevance, little information about their tolerance mechanism to cope with harsh environmental conditions is reported. 14-3-3 proteins have been linked with primary metabolism and hormones responses. Here we present the characterization of the first Opuntia ficus-indica 14-3-3 (Op14-3-3) protein using AP-MS strategy. Op14-3-3 has high homology with other 14-3-3 from Caryophyllales. A novel Op14-3-3 client protein has been identified; the chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase, key enzyme that links the primary with secondary metabolism. The present results open new questions about the Opuntia spp. pathways mechanisms in response to environmental stress and the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in betalains biosynthesis.\"\n",

Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were implicated in the regulation of ethylene induction by stresses. However, the kinase(s) involved remains to be determined. We demonstrate that the activation of SIPK, a tobacco mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), by NtMEK2DD, an active mutant of the upstream kinase of SIPK, results in a dramatic increase in ethylene production. This increase coincides with a dramatic increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) activity. This is followed by the activation of a subgroup of ACS and ACC oxidase (ACO) genes. Infection with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) also induces the same ACSs and ACOs. After ethylene production in NtMEK2DD plants, strong activation of ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) genes is observed. In contrast to previous reports, no major increase in jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MJ) is detected after the activation of SIPK/WIPK in NtMEK2DD transgenic plants. These results suggest that the induction of ethylene but not JA/MJ is involved in plant defense responses mediated by the NtMEK2-SIPK/WIPK pathway.\"\n",

A transcriptomic analysis identified genes whose expression is specifically affected by each phenomenon, including OXIDATIVE SIGNAL INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) encoding an AGC kinase. OXI1 was noticeably induced by excess light energy and (1)O2 stress conditions leading to cell death. Photo-induced oxidative damage and cell death were drastically reduced in the OXI1 null mutant (oxi1) and in the double mutant ch1*oxi1 compared with the wild type and the ch1 single mutant, respectively. This occurred without any changes in the production rate of (1)O2, but was cancelled by exogenous applications of the phytohormone jasmonate. OXI1-mediated (1)O2 signaling operated through a different pathway from the previously characterized OXI1-dependent response to pathogens and H2O2 and was found to be independent of the EXECUTER proteins. In high-light-stressed plants, the oxi1 mutation was associated with reduced jasmonate levels and with the up-regulation of genes encoding negative regulators of jasmonate signaling and PCD. OXI1 was found to be a new regulator of (1)O2-induced PCD, likely acting upstream of jasmonate.\"\n",

Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO(2) in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for 1 h with 10 µL L(-1) NO(2.) Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen resistance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease resistance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO(2)-induced resistance against B. cinerea An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO(2) exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO(2)-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO(2)-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO(2)-triggered B. cinerea resistance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and CYTOCHROME P450 79B2 (CYP79B2), CYP79B3, and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 gene functions but independent of camalexin, CYP81F2, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO(2) triggers basal pathogen resistance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO(2) in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.\n"

      "Rewrite the following text so that each sentence only expresses one biological relationship: GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) encodes a soluble gibberellin (GA) receptor that shares sequence similarity with a hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Previously, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed that the GID1-GA complex directly interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor protein in GA signaling. Here, we demonstrated, by pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, that the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction also occurs in planta. GA(4) was found to have the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta. Domain analyses of SLR1 using Y2H, gel filtration, and BiFC methods revealed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1-SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1, such as the spontaneous mutant GID1s, N- and C-terminal truncated GID1s, and mutagenized GID1 proteins with conserved amino acids replaced with Ala. The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding that were scattered throughout the GID1 molecule. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure predicted by analogy with HSL tertiary structure, many residues were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Furthermore, the GA-GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. Based on these observations, we proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.\n"

      "Rewrite the following text so that each sentence only expresses one biological relationship: BACKGROUND: Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium species like F. graminearum is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality. Resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, but the molecular events leading to FHB resistance are still poorly understood. Transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars Dream (moderately resistant) and Lynx (susceptible). The gene expressions at 32 and 72 h after inoculation with Fusarium were used to trace possible defence mechanisms and associated genes. A comparative qPCR was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3 (Chinese spring wheat). RESULTS: Among 2,169 differentially expressed genes, two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the FHB-resistant Dream cultivar. Both are defined base on their specific mode of resistance. A non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling, including lipid-transfer protein, thionin, defensin and GDSL-like lipase genes. Additionally, defence-related genes encoding jasmonate-regulated proteins were up-regulated in response to FHB. Another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential Fusarium virulence factors comprising proteases and mycotoxins was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat. Moreover, similar inductions upon fungal infection were frequently observed among FHB-responsive genes of both mechanisms in the cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. CONCLUSIONS: Especially ABC transporter, UDP-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors are apparently active in different resistant genetic backgrounds, according to reports on other wheat cultivars and barley. This was further supported in our qPCR experiments on seven genes originating from this mechanism which revealed similar activities in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. Finally, the combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars. The respective mechanisms are attractive for advanced studies aiming at new resistance and toxin management strategies.\n"

Among the defense proteins known to be regulated by ethylene is maize insect resistance 1-cysteine protease (Mir1-CP).

Immunoblot analysis of Mir1-CP accumulation and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction examination of mir1 levels in these treated plants demonstrate that Mir1-CP accumulation is regulated by both transcript abundance and protein expression levels.

Differential Scanning Fluorimetry, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry were used for Op14-3-3 μ protein characterization, and Affinity-Purification-Mass Spectrometry analysis approach was used to obtain information about their potential client proteins. Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit, and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase were identified. Interestingly chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase was also identified. Op14-3-3 μ down-regulation was observed in Opuntia calluses when they were induced with Jasmonic Acid, while increased accumulation of Op14-3-3 μ protein was observed. The putative interaction of 14-3-3 μ with chorismate mutase, which have not been reported before, suggest that Op14-3-3 μ could be an important regulator of metabolites biosynthesis and responses to stress in Opuntia spp. SIGNIFICANCE: Opuntia species are important crops in arid and semiarid areas worldwide, but despite its relevance, little information about their tolerance mechanism to cope with harsh environmental conditions is reported. 14-3-3 proteins have gained attention due to its participation as protein-protein regulators and have been linked with primary metabolism and hormones responses. Here we present the characterization of the first Opuntia ficus-indica 14-3-3 (Op14-3-3) protein using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy. Op14-3-3 has high homology with other 14-3-3 from Caryophyllales. A novel Op14-3-3 client protein has been identified; the chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase, key enzyme that links the primary with secondary metabolism. The present results open new questions about the Opuntia spp. pathways mechanisms in response to environmental stress and the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in betalains biosynthesis.\n"

Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO(2) in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for 1 h with 10 \\u00b5L L(-1) NO(2). Leaf symptoms were absent, indicating that NO(2) induces basal disease resistance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO(2)-induced resistance against B. cinerea. An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation was observed immediately after NO(2) exposure, followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism was simultaneously induced by NO(2), resulting in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile.

These responses, which are mediated by phytochrome, include hyponasty (i.e. a more vertical orientation of leaves) and enhanced stem and petiole elongation. We recently showed that ethylene-insensitive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants (Tetr) have reduced responses to neighbors, indicating an important role for this gaseous plant hormone in shade avoidance. Here, we investigate interactions between phytochrome signaling and ethylene action in shade avoidance responses. Additionally, we investigate if ethylene acts in these responses through an interaction with the GA class of hormones. \\n\\nLow red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) increase ethylene production in wild-type tobacco, resulting in shade avoidance responses, whereas ethylene-insensitive plants show reduced shade avoidance responses. Plants with inhibited GA production show hardly any shade avoidance responses to either a low R:FR or increased ethylene concentrations. Furthermore, low R:FR enhances the responsiveness of hyponasty and stem elongation in both wild-type and Tetr plants to applied GA(3), with the stem elongation process being more responsive to GA(3) in the wild type than in Tetr. \\n\\nWe conclude that phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses involve ethylene action, at least partly by modulating GA action.\"\n",

GA(4) had the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta. Y2H, gel filtration, and BiFC methods revealed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1-SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1. The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding that were scattered throughout the GID1 molecule. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure predicted by analogy with HSL tertiary structure, many residues were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Furthermore, the GA-GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. We proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.\"\n",

Mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality. Resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, but the molecular events leading to FHB resistance are still poorly understood. Transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars Dream (moderately resistant) and Lynx (susceptible). The gene expressions at 32 and 72 h after inoculation with Fusarium were used to trace possible defence mechanisms and associated genes. A comparative qPCR was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3 (Chinese spring wheat).\\n\\nAmong 2,169 differentially expressed genes, two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the FHB-resistant Dream cultivar. A non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling, including lipid-transfer protein, thionin, defensin and GDSL-like lipase genes. Additionally, defence-related genes encoding jasmonate-regulated proteins were up-regulated in response to FHB. Another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential Fusarium virulence factors comprising proteases and mycotoxins was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat.\\n\\nABC transporter, UDP-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors were observed to be active in different resistant genetic backgrounds, according to reports on other wheat cultivars and barley. This was further supported in qPCR experiments on seven genes originating from this mechanism which revealed similar activities in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3.\\n\\nThe combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars.

Maize insect resistance 1-cysteine protease (Mir1-CP) is known to be regulated by ethylene. The insect-resistant maize (Zea mays) genotype Mp708 constitutively expresses Mir1-CP; however, its abundance increases significantly during fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory. Within 1 h of herbivory by fall armyworm, Mir1-CP accumulates at the feeding site and continues to increase in abundance until 24 h without any increase in its transcript (mir1) levels. To investigate the role of ethylene and jasmonate in the signaling of Mir1-CP expression, the effects of phytohormone biosynthesis and perception inhibitors on Mir1-CP expression were tested. Immunoblot analysis of Mir1-CP accumulation and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction examination of mir1 levels in these treated plants showed that Mir1-CP accumulation is regulated by both transcript abundance and protein expression levels. The results also indicated that jasmonate functions upstream of ethylene in the Mir1-CP expression pathway, allowing for both low-level constitutive expression and a two-stage defensive response, an immediate response involving Mir1-CP accumulation and a delayed response inducing mir1 transcript expression.\"\n",

Ethylene is perceived by ethylene receptors, which triggers cellular responses further downstream. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate ethylene induction by stresses, based on studies using protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. The kinase(s) involved remains to be determined. A conditional gain-of-function transgenic system was used to demonstrate that the activation of SIPK, a tobacco mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), by NtMEK2DD, an active mutant of the upstream kinase of SIPK, resulted in a dramatic increase in ethylene production. This increase in ethylene coincided with a dramatic increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) activity, which was followed by the activation of a subgroup of ACS and ACC oxidase (ACO) genes. This suggests that either the activation of unidentified ACS(s) or post-transcriptional regulation is involved. Infection with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) also induced the same ACSs and ACOs. After ethylene production in NtMEK2DD plants, strong activation of ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) genes was observed, similar to the effect in NN tobacco plants infected with TMV. No major increase in jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MJ) was detected after the activation of SIPK/WIPK in NtMEK2DD transgenic plants. This suggests that the induction of ethylene but not JA/MJ is involved in plant defense responses mediated by the NtMEK2-SIPK/WIPK pathway.\"\n",

H(2)S is produced in plants via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways in different subcellular compartments. Exogenous application of H(2)S facilitates metabolic processes and antioxidant machinery in plants under normal and environmental stresses. H(2)S interacts with phytohormones such as auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. H(2)S also participates in signal transductions of other signaling molecules such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, calcium, methylglyoxal, and hydrogen peroxide. H(2)S mediates post-translational modification, which is a protective mechanism against oxidative damage of proteins. This review summarizes the roles of H(2)S as an intriguing molecule in plants.\"\n",

A transcriptomic analysis of the ch1 mutant has allowed the identification of genes whose expression is specifically affected by each phenomenon. One such gene is OXIDATIVE SIGNAL INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) encoding an AGC kinase. OXI1 was noticeably induced by excess light energy and (1)O2 stress conditions leading to cell death. Photo-induced oxidative damage and cell death were drastically reduced in the OXI1 null mutant (oxi1) and in the double mutant ch1*oxi1 compared with the wild type and the ch1 single mutant, respectively. This was associated with reduced jasmonate levels and with the up-regulation of genes encoding negative regulators of jasmonate signaling and PCD. Exogenous applications of the phytohormone jasmonate cancelled the reduced photo-induced oxidative damage and cell death. OXI1-mediated (1)O2 signaling appeared to operate through a different pathway from the previously characterized OXI1-dependent response to pathogens and H2O2 and was found to be independent of the EXECUTER proteins. Our results show that OXI1 is a new regulator of (1)O2-induced PCD, likely acting upstream of jasmonate.\"\n",
